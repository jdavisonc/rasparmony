Rasparmony
========

Like Harmony but with a RaspberryPI - [https://medium.com/@jdavisonc/rasparmony-857ac725aa64]

With Rasparmony you will be able to control all your devices with your smartphone, moreover Rasparmony enables you to run macros! Yes, macros... a set of commands to different devices. This is, turn on your TV, the Home Theather and set input mode to HDMI1 on the TV.

Rasparmony starts as fork of `lirc_web` with the idea to extend it. It has a lot of new features in order to be user friendly with a easy setup. 

Rasparmony use:

* LIRC Web - [https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web]

## Configuration

The configuration of Rasparmony should be prety easy. First, you need to configure your remotes codes on lirc and then start Rasparmony and redirect to `Configuration` section, after that add your remotes or macros via the UI and save it. The UI will create a file `config.json` with the proper configuration.

If you anyway want to configure Rasparmony via file, please check the format below:

config.json
```
{
  "remotes": [
    {
      "name": "TV",              /* name of the remote */
      "code": "LHV4420",         /* code used on lirc to identify the remote, used on lircd.conf */
      "commandAlias": {
        "INPUT": "tv/rad",       /* command alias, if there is no alias then will use the one passed to the API */
        "INFO": "KEY_INFO"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "HomeTheater",     
      "code": "888888"			 
    }
  ],
  "macros": [
    {
      "name": "TV", 			 /* name of the macro */
      "icon": "gamepad",         /* icon from font-awesome */
      "commands": [
        {
          "remote": "LHV4420",   /* code of the remote on section remotes */
          "command": "KEY_POWER" /* standard lirc key to send */
        },
        {
          "remote": "888888",
