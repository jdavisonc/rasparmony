Rasparmony
========

Like Harmony but with a RaspberryPI - [https://medium.com/@jdavisonc/rasparmony-857ac725aa64]

With Rasparmony you will be able to control all your IR devices with your smartphone, moreover Rasparmony enables you to run macros! Yes, macros... a set of commands to run of different devices. This is, turn on your TV, the Home Theather and set input mode to HDMI1 on the TV, all in one click.

Rasparmony starts as fork of `lirc_web` with the idea to extend it. It has a lot of new features in order to be user friendly with an easy setup.

Rasparmony use:

* LIRC Web - [https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_web]
* LIRC Node - [https://github.com/alexbain/lirc_node]
* MobileAngularUI - [http://mobileangularui.com/]

## Features

* API based
* Send plain IR commands through API
* Device and commands alias
* Mobile WebUI to easy configure your devices
* *Device States*: Holds the device state depending on the configuration. This enable the user to configure macros in a more real way instead of set how many time the command X should be send. Just set the expected state of the device in the macro, supports more than one state per device (see config.json).

## Usage

### From GIT repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jdavisonc/rasparmony.git
$ cd rasparmony

$ npm install
$ npm app.js
```

To start Rasparmony on boot time you will need to execute the following commands:
```
sudo npm install forever -g
cp init.d/rasparmony /etc/init.d/.
chmod +x init.d/rasparmony
sudo update-rc.d rasparmony default

# Now you can execute Rasparmony as a Service on your RasperryPI
sudo service rasparmony start|stop
```

NOTE: Update `RASPARMONY_PATH` variable with the actual PATH where you locate Rasparmony code.

### From Docker image

```
docker build -t rasparmony .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000-e RASPARMONY_CONFIG=/rasparmony/config/config.json --device /dev/mem:/dev/mem -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules -v /rasparmony/config:config --cap-add=ALL --rm --privileged -it rasparmony
```

Variables:
* LIRC_GPIO_IN - Default 16
* LIRC_GPIO_OUT - Default 23

## Configuration

The configuration of Rasparmony should be prety easy. First, you need to configure your remotes codes on lirc and then start Rasparmony and redirect to `Configuration` section, after that add your remotes or macros via the UI and save it. The UI will create a file `config.json` with the proper configuration.

If you anyway want to configure Rasparmony via file, please check the format below:

config.json
```
